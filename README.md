4. Click **Install**.

### Option 2: **Portable Standalone Edition** (No ComfyUI required)

1. Download the [Portable Package](https://github.com/willmiao/ComfyUI-Lora-Manager/releases/download/v0.9.8/lora_manager_portable.7z)
2. Copy the provided `settings.json.example` file to create a new file named `settings.json` in `comfyui-lora-manager` folder. Only adjust the API key, optional language, and folder paths‚Äîthe library registry is generated automatically at runtime.
3. Edit the new `settings.json` to include your correct model folder paths and CivitAI API key (or keep the placeholders until you are ready to configure them)
   - Set `"use_portable_settings": true` if you want the configuration to remain inside the repository folder instead of your user settings directory.
4. Run run.bat
    - To change the startup port, edit `run.bat` and modify the parameter (e.g. `--port 9001`)

### Option 3: **Manual Installation**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/willmiao/ComfyUI-Lora-Manager.git
cd ComfyUI-Lora-Manager
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. There are two ways to access the LoRA manager:
   - Click the "Launch LoRA Manager" button in the ComfyUI menu
   - Visit http://localhost:8188/loras directly
2. From the interface, you can:
   - Browse and organize your LoRA models
   - Download models directly from CivitAI
   - Automatically fetch or manually set preview images
   - View and copy trigger words associated with each LoRA
   - Add personal notes and usage tips
3. To use LoRAs in your workflow:
   - Add the "Lora Loader (LoraManager)" node to your workflow
   - Select a LoRA in the manager interface
   - Click copy button or use right-click menu "Copy LoRA syntax"
   - Paste into the Lora Loader node's text input
   - The node will automatically apply preset strength and trigger words

### Filename Format Patterns for Save Image Node

The Save Image Node supports dynamic filename generation using pattern codes. You can customize how your images are named using the following format patterns:

#### Available Pattern Codes

- `%seed%` - Inserts the generation seed number
- `%width%` - Inserts the image width
- `%height%` - Inserts the image height
- `%pprompt:N%` - Inserts the positive prompt (limited to N characters)
- `%nprompt:N%` - Inserts the negative prompt (limited to N characters)
- `%model:N%` - Inserts the model/checkpoint name (limited to N characters)
- `%date%` - Inserts current date/time as "yyyyMMddhhmmss"
- `%date:FORMAT%` - Inserts date using custom format with:
  - `yyyy` - 4-digit year
  - `yy` - 2-digit year
  - `MM` - 2-digit month
  - `dd` - 2-digit day
  - `hh` - 2-digit hour
  - `mm` - 2-digit minute
  - `ss` - 2-digit second

#### Examples

- `image_%seed%` ‚Üí `image_1234567890`
- `gen_%width%x%height%` ‚Üí `gen_512x768`
- `%model:10%_%seed%` ‚Üí `dreamshape_1234567890`
- `%date:yyyy-MM-dd%` ‚Üí `2025-04-28`
- `%pprompt:20%_%seed%` ‚Üí `beautiful landscape_1234567890`
- `%model%_%date:yyMMdd%_%seed%` ‚Üí `dreamshaper_v8_250428_1234567890`

You can combine multiple patterns to create detailed, organized filenames for your generated images.

### Standalone Mode

You can now run LoRA Manager independently from ComfyUI:

1. **For ComfyUI users**:
   - Launch ComfyUI with LoRA Manager at least once to initialize the necessary path information in the `settings.json` file located in your user settings folder (see paths above).
   - Make sure dependencies are installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - From your ComfyUI root directory, run:
     ```bash
     python custom_nodes\comfyui-lora-manager\standalone.py
     ```
   - Access the interface at: `http://localhost:8188/loras`
   - You can specify a different host or port with arguments:
     ```bash
     python custom_nodes\comfyui-lora-manager\standalone.py --host 127.0.0.1 --port 9000
     ```

2. **For non-ComfyUI users**:
   - Copy the provided `settings.json.example` file to create a new file named `settings.json`. Update the API key, optional language, and folder paths only‚Äîthe library registry is created automatically when LoRA Manager starts.
   - Edit `settings.json` to include your correct model folder paths and CivitAI API key (you can leave the defaults until ready to configure them)
   - Enable portable mode by setting `"use_portable_settings": true` if you prefer LoRA Manager to read and write the `settings.json` located in the project directory.
   - Install required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - Run standalone mode:
     ```bash
     python standalone.py
     ```
   - Access the interface through your browser at: `http://localhost:8188/loras`

   > **Note:** Existing installations automatically migrate the legacy `settings.json` from the plugin folder to the user settings directory the first time you launch this version.

This standalone mode provides a lightweight option for managing your model and recipe collection without needing to run the full ComfyUI environment, making it useful even for users who primarily use other stable diffusion interfaces.

## Testing & Coverage

### Backend

Install the development dependencies and run pytest with coverage reports:

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
COVERAGE_FILE=coverage/backend/.coverage pytest \
  --cov=py \
  --cov=standalone \
  --cov-report=term-missing \
  --cov-report=html:coverage/backend/html \
  --cov-report=xml:coverage/backend/coverage.xml \
  --cov-report=json:coverage/backend/coverage.json
```

HTML, XML, and JSON artifacts are stored under `coverage/backend/` so you can inspect hot spots locally or from CI artifacts.

### Frontend

Run the Vitest coverage suite to analyze widget hot spots:

```bash
npm run test:coverage
```
